## Definition

The Morning Star is a three-candlestick pattern that indicates a bullish reversal. It consists of a long bearish candle, a small-bodied candle (open and close are close together) that gaps down, and a third long bullish candle that gaps up and closes well into the body of the first candle.

## Pattern Structure

1.  **Candle 1**: Long red candle (downtrend continuation).
2.  **Candle 2**: Small body (red or green) that gaps down from Candle 1. Ideally a Doji or Spinning Top.
3.  **Candle 3**: Long green candle that gaps up from Candle 2 and closes above the midpoint of Candle 1.

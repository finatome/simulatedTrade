## Definition

A Doji is a candlestick pattern that forms when a security's open and close are virtually equal for the given time period. The length of the upper and lower shadows can vary, and the resulting candlestick looks like a cross, inverted cross, or plus sign. A Doji indicates a sense of indecision or neutrality between buyers and sellers.

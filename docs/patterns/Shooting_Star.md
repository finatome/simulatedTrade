## Trading Significance

1.  **Rejection of Highs**: Shows that buyers pushed prices up, but sellers overwhelmed them to push the price back down.
2.  **Bearish Signal**: Indicates potential exhaustion of the uptrend.
3.  **Confirmation**: Look for a gap down or a long red candle following the shooting star.

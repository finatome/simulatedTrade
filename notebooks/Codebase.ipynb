I perform buy, hold and sell or short etc in Futures market data (simulated), the data runs quickly once I put the trade and show the result. This way the simulator provide me the random scenarios for me to make trading decision. I take trading action, it runs the full show of the market piece and show me the profit or loss.

    "\n",
    "* **Volatility Clustering:** High volatility should follow high volatility.\n",

    "The next 50 candles print at 10 candles per second. You watch your P&L fluctuate in real-time. This trains your **emotional regulation**—watching a trade go red before hitting your target.\n",

    "Fourth-order indicators suffer heavily from the **\"Lag-Smoothing Paradox.\"** To remove noise from the random walk, they apply multiple layers of Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) or Weighted Moving Averages (WMAs). While this makes the indicator look like a \"smooth cycle,\" it introduces significant lag. Under GBM, the current price is the best predictor of the next price; by the time these complex indicators signal a \"trend,\" the random walk has already likely moved into a new, independent increment phase.\n",

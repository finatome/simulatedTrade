Generation Pipeline \u00b6 Volatility-Aware GBM Uses a discrete Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) update with mu = 0.0001 and a time step of one five-minute bar.

If you extend add_technical_indicators() , keep names descriptive and unique so downstream components can reference them unambiguously. This comprehensive catalog provides a technical breakdown of all 85 indicators organized by their mathematical complexity. Indicator Groups \u00b6 I. First-Order Primitives (Base Data Discretization) \u00b6 Simplest transforms of raw Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data. Average Price (AP) : An arithmetic mean of the High, Low, and Close for a single period. Equation: \\((H + L + C) / 3\\) Category: Trend/Benchmark Use Case: Provides a simplified representation of a single bar's price action. Median Price (MP) : The exact middle point between the High and Low of a specific time period. Equation: \\((H + L) / 2\\) Category: Trend/Benchmark Use Case: Identifies the midpoint of a bar's range, often used as an input for oscillators. Typical Price (TP) : A standard price calculation used as a more accurate representation of the average price than just the close. Equation: \\((H + L + C) / 3\\) Category: Trend/Benchmark Use Case: Serves as the base input for more complex indicators like CCI and VWAP. Volume (V) : The total number of shares or contracts traded during a specific time interval. Equation: \\(\\sum \\text{Trades}\\) Category: Volume Use Case: Gauges market activity and validates the strength of price moves. Standard Deviation (StdDev) : A statistical measure of how much price deviates from its mean. Equation: \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\) Category: Volatility Use Case: Quantifies market risk and serves as the backbone for Bollinger Bands. Historical Volatility (HV) : The realized variance of an asset based on past price changes. Equation: \\(\\text{Annualized StdDev of Log Returns}\\) Category: Volatility Use Case: Assesses the historical risk profile and prices options. Volatility Close-to-Close (C-C Vol) : A volatility estimate calculated using only the closing prices of consecutive bars. Equation: \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum (\\ln(\\frac{C_t}{C_{t-1}}) - \\mu)^2}\\) Category: Volatility Use Case: Measures price dispersion specifically focused on settlement prices. Volatility O-H-L-C (OHLC Vol) : A more efficient volatility estimator that incorporates the intrabar range. Equation: Uses Parkinson or Garman-Klass formulas (e.g., \\(0.511(H-L)^2 - \\dots\\) ) Category: Volatility Use Case: Provides a more granular risk assessment than close-only models. Volatility Zero-Trend C-C (Z-Trend Vol) : A variance calculation that assumes the mean return (drift) is zero. Equation: \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum (\\ln(\\frac{C_t}{C_{t-1}}))^2}\\) Category: Volatility Use Case: Useful for high-frequency data where drift is negligible. Rate of Change (ROC) : Measures the percentage change in price between the current period and a period \\(n\\) days ago. Equation: \\((\\frac{C_t - C_{t-n}}{C_{t-n}}) \\times 100\\) Category: Momentum Use Case: Identifies price velocity and potential trend exhaustion.

It is designed to allow a trader to keep a position open as long as the trend is valid, while protecting profits by trailing the stop loss. The indicator calculates two lines: a \"Long Stop\" (for long positions) and a \"Short Stop\" (for short positions). These stops are derived from the Average True Range (ATR) and the highest highs/lowest lows of the asset, ensuring the stop is placed outside the typical noise of market volatility.
